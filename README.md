# Excelsior
Bundle with useful standard content templates for sulu.io > 2.0

# The template
The main template of Excelsior is so constructed that it uses a block renderer and multiple blocks.

## Overriding the XML templates
As there is no inheritance you would have to copy all the XML files from Resources/templates to your own project to alter any of those.

### XI Includes
Please be aware that an IDE like PHPStorm might have trouble with displaying the XML includes as being correct.
Th#ey are anyways :) 

## Paragraph
The main content of the Excelsior template. This is a journalistic content paragraph that hopefully fits all your needs to easily create meaningful content.
Any input is optional so you can use this to create text or image paragraphs only if you like.
